# Unstable server downloader
Just something I made when Minecraft Forge's download servers were unstable, but now it can be used as a download manager if your connection is unstable or if the server is having issues.

## Usage
After building with `dotnet publish -c release -r <operating-system>`, run it with `UnstableServerDownloader.exe <url> (file location where to save - optional)`
